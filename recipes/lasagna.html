        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <h4>Making the Meat Sauce:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Place a deep pan or dutch oven over medium/high heat and add 1 tbsp olive oil, 1 lb ground beef and diced onion. Saute, breaking up the meat, for 5 minutes or until beef is no longer pink. Add pressed garlic and saute another minute until fragrant.</li>
            <li>Add 1/4 cup wine (or beef broth) and stir for 2 minutes or until wine is nearly evaporated. Add 3 cups marinara, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp pepper, 1/4 tsp thyme, 1/2 tsp sugar, and 2 tbsp parsley. Bring to a simmer then cover and cook for 5 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h4>Making the Cheese Sauce:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine 16 oz cottage cheese, 15 oz ricotta, 1 cup mozzarella, 1 egg, and 2 tbsp parsley. Mix well.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Making the Lasagna:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 deg F. Bring a large pot of water to boil. Add salt and 9 lasagna noodles. Cooke until al dente according to package instructions.</li>
            <li>Spread 1/2 cup meat sauce in the bottom of a deep 9x13 casserole dish. Add 3 noodles, spread on 1/3 of the meat sauce, and sprinkle with 1 cup mozzarella cheese. Sppon on and spread the top with 1/2 of your cheese sauce.</li>
            <li>Repeat until you have 3 layers of noodles: Add 3 noodles, 1/3 meat sauce, 1 cup mozarella cheese, 1/2 cheese sauce. Add 3 noodles, remaining 1/3 meat sauce, remaining 1 cup mozarella.</li>
            <li>Poke 9-12 toothpicks over the surface of your lasagna (to keep the foilt from sticking to the cheese). Cover with foil and bake at 375 deg F for 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove foil and broil for 3 to 5 minutes, or until cheese turns golden. Let lasagna rest for 30 minutes before slicing.</li>
